For each of these studies, there are specialized cells in certain objectives. Among those in the dataset: \n\n*Basophil*: A subtype of white blood cell (blood defense cells), which aims to release Histamine and Heparin when necessary. They are about 1.5% of the total white blood cells, appearing between 0 to 200 basophils per cubic millimeter of blood in a healthy person. Eosinophils: Another subtype of blood defense cell, are numerous when there is presence of some infection. They range from about 1 to 5% of blood defense cells and, in healthy people, they are between 40,000 and 500,000 cells per milliliter of blood.\n\n*Eosinophil*: Another subtype of blood defense cell, are numerous when there is presence of some infection. They range from about 1 to 5% of blood defense cells and, in healthy people, they are between 40,000 and 500,000 cells per milliliter of blood. \n\n*Erythroblast*: Among those present, it is the only cell that is not part of white blood cells. Such, cells that give rise to erythrocytes, which have the function of transporting gases in the blood. They are very numerous and appear between 3.8 million and 5.2 million units per milliliter of blood.\n\n*IG (immunoglobins)*: They are glycoprotein molecules produced by plasmocytes to respond to some specific type of imunogen and function as antibodies. Its purpose is to bind to some specific antigen to ensure protection of an organism. \nLymphocytes: Another specific type of white blood cells, therefore have a defense function in the body. Among the types of lymphophytes there are type T, B and NK cells. Its concentration may indicate infections (at times of discharge) or indicate diseases such as anemia and leukemia (at times of low). There are usually about 1500 to 3000 cells per cubic millimeter of blood.\n\n*Monocyte*: Another defense cell. Its main characteristic is the small life cycle and its great differentiation to act in different parts of the body (liver, nervous system, epidermis, etc. High monocytes may indicate diseases such as ulcerative colitis, leukemia, and some autoimmune diseases, while at low times may indicate bone marrow problems, HPV, or other comorbidities. They represent about 2 to 10% of the total leukocytes and range between 300 and 900 units per cubic millimeter. \n\n*Neutrophil*: Known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, they are a very numerous type of cell present in white blood cells, with the aim of defending the individual from infections caused by different types of viruses and bacteria, as they have a high capacity to perform phagocytosis (a process in which a cell encompasses solid particles). In general, about 2300 to 8100 cubic millimetres are present.\n\n*Platelet*: Small fragments of a cell type called megakaryocyte and has the main function of clotting the blood to prevent major bleeding. Generally, about 150,000 to 450,000 cubic millimetres of blood are present. Values above may indicate thrombocytosis, bone marrow changes, or hemolytic anemias. While in low-supple situations, they may indicate infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies or spleen problems.\n\n\n**why is it useful to recognize different types of cells with computer vision?**\n\nRecognizing and differentiating different cell types in the blood can help health professionals optimize work routines, automate steamy tasks, and automatically detect the possibility of some disease\n\n\nReferences:\nJunqueira's Basic Histology Text and Atlas, 14th Edition\nhttps://www.tuasaude.com/ (portuguese)\nhttps://escolaeducacao.com.br/ (portuguese)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Creating a deep learning model with keras.\n\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential()\nmodel.add(keras.Input(shape=(300, 300, 3)))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape = (300, 300, 3)))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, padding='same'))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Flatten())\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='softmax'))\n\nmodel.summary()\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-19T05:29:56.044485Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-19T05:29:56.044905Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-19T05:29:56.113702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-19T05:29:56.044869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-19T05:29:56.112530Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Training the model with 15 iterations\nmodel.fit(train_dataset, epochs=15, validation_data=validation_dataset)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-19T05:29:58.867922Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-19T05:29:58.868934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-19T05:35:46.377085Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-19T05:29:58.868896Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-19T05:35:46.373025Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#mins and max values from the training:\n\nmin_loss_train = min(model.history.history['loss'])\nmin_loss_val = min(model.history.history['val_loss'])\n                \nmax_accuracy_train = max(model.history.history['accuracy'])\nmax_accuracy_val = max(model.history.history['val_accuracy'])\n\n\nprint('Mininum of loss value from training dataset: ', round(min_loss_train, 4))\nprint('Mininum of loss value from validation dataset: ', round(min_loss_val, 4))\nprint()\nprint('Max accuracy from training dataset: ', round(max_accuracy_train*100, 2), '%')\nprint('Max accuracy from training dataset: ', round(max_accuracy_val*100, 2), '%')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.628474Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.628885Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.628693Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.628712Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Development of training:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\nplt.plot(model.history.history['accuracy'], color='tab:orange', marker='o')\nplt.title('Accuracy of training dataset')\nplt.xlabel('epochs')\nplt.ylabel('accuracy')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\nplt.plot(model.history.history['loss'], color='tab:orange', marker='o')\nplt.title('Loss of training dataset')\nplt.xlabel('epochs')\nplt.ylabel('Loss function value')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\nplt.plot(model.history.history['val_accuracy'], color='tab:blue', marker='o')\nplt.title('Accuracy of validation dataset')\nplt.xlabel('epochs')\nplt.ylabel('accuracy')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\nplt.plot(model.history.history['val_loss'], color='tab:blue', marker='o')\nplt.title('Loss of validation dataset')\nplt.xlabel('epochs')\nplt.ylabel('Loss function value')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.630813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.631803Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.631451Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-19T05:29:53.631485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Seeing the results:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))\nplot_dim = 5\ncounter = 1\n\nfor img in validation_dataset:\n    plt.subplot(plot_dim, plot_dim, counter)\n    plt.axis('off')\n    plt.imshow(img[0][0]) #
